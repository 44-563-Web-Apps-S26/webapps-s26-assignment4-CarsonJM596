                        RUTH                            FREDERIC

                Don't, beloved master,         Yes, your former master
                Crush me with disaster.        Saves you from disaster.
            What is such a dower to the     Your love would be uncomfortably
                dower I have here              fervid, it is clear
                My love unabating              If, as you are stating
                Has been accumulating          It's been accumulating
            Forty-seven year, forty-seven   Forty-seven year—forty-seven year!
                year!                      Faithless woman to deceive me, I
                                                who trusted so!
            Master, master, do not leave    Faithless woman to deceive me, I
                me, hear me, ere I go!         who trusted so!

                                    RECIT—FREDERIC

                        What shall I do?  Before these gentle maidens
                        I dare not show in this alarming costume!
                        No, no, I must remain in close concealment
                        Until I can appear in decent clothing!

            (Hides in cave as they enter climbing over the rocks and through
                arched rock)

            GIRLS:    Climbing over rocky mountain,
                        Skipping rivulet and fountain,
                        Passing where the willows quiver,
                        Passing where the willows quiver
                        By the ever-rolling river,
                            Swollen with the summer rain, the summer rain
                        Threading long and leafy mazes
                        Dotted with unnumbered daisies,
                        Dotted, dotted with unnumbered daisies,
                        Scaling rough and rugged passes,
                        Climb the hardy little lasses,
                            Till the bright sea-shore they gain;
                        Scaling rough and rugged passes,
                        Climb the hardy little lasses,
                            Till the bright sea-shore they gain!

            EDITH:    Let us gaily tread the measure,
                        Make the most of fleeting leisure,
                        Hail it as a true ally,
                        Though it perish by-and-by.

            GIRLS:         Hail it as a true ally,
                            Though it perish by-and-by.

            EDITH:    Every moment brings a treasure
                        Of its own especial pleasure;
                        Though the moments quickly die,
                        Greet them gaily as they fly,
                        Greet them gaily as they fly.

            GIRLS:    Though the moments quickly die,
                        Greet them gaily as they fly.

            KATE:     Far away from toil and care,
                        Revelling in fresh sea-air,
                        Here we live and reign alone
                        In a world that's all our own.
                        Here, in this our rocky den,
                        Far away from mortal men,
                        We'll be queens, and make decrees—
                        They may honour them who please.

            GIRLS:    We'll be queens, and make decrees—
                        They may honour them who please.
                        Let us gaily tread the measure, etc.

            KATE:     What a picturesque spot! I wonder where we are!
            EDITH:    And I wonder where Papa is.  We have left him ever so
                        far behind.
            ISABEL:   Oh, he will be here presently! Remember poor Papa is
                        not as young as we are, and we came over a rather
                        difficult country.
            KATE:     But how thoroughly delightful it is to be so entirely
                        alone! Why, in all probability we are the first human
                        beings who ever set foot on this enchanting spot.
            ISABEL:   Except the mermaids—it's the very place for mermaids.
            KATE:     Who are only human beings down to the waist—
            EDITH:    And who can't be said strictly to set foot anywhere.
                        Tails they may, but feet they cannot.
            KATE:     But what shall we do until Papa and the servants arrive
                        with the luncheon?
            EDITH:    We are quite alone, and the sea is as smooth as glass.
                        Suppose we take off our shoes and stockings and paddle?
            ALL:      Yes, yes!  The very thing!  (They prepare to carry, out
                        the suggestion. They have all taken off one shoe, when
                        FREDERIC comes forward from cave.)
